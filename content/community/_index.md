## The State of the Project

Since The Qt Company stopped working on Qbs, it has been developed by the open-source community.
We greatly improved the project since then, added a lot of new features and reworked core parts
to boost performance. We hit a mahor milestone in April 2023, when we
[released](../blog/release-2.0.0/) Qbs 2.0. For mor details on the State of the Project,
see the related [blog post](../blog/project-state/).

## Source Repository

The main source code repository is hosted at
[codereview.qt-project.org](https://codereview.qt-project.org/q/project:qbs/qbs).

## Contributing

There are several ways to contribute to Qbs.

First, try it in your project! If you encounter a bug or want a new feature to be added, report
it to the [bug tracker](https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QBS/),
[Discord server](https://discord.gg/zhMHvC5GNa) or
[mailing list](https://lists.qt-project.org/mailman/listinfo/qbs). See docs about how to
[install](../docs/installing/) Qbs and [start using](../docs/language-introduction/) it.
The [tutorial](../docs/tutorial/) is also a great place to start.

Second, while developing a new functionality in your Project, such as when writing a new
[Module](../docs/qml-qbslanguageitems-module/) -
consider making it public on [GitHub](https://github.com) and marking with a tag
[qbs-module](https://github.com/topics/qbs-module).

Third, you might want to add a new feature yourself. In that case, the
[Contributing](https://github.com/qbs/qbs/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) page is a place to start.
You can always ask questions about how to implement the new feature in the best way on the
[Discord server](https://discord.gg/zhMHvC5GNa).
